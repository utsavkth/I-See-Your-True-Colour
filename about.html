    <!-- Section: Caution -->
    <div class="card">
      <h1>⚠️ Caution: Story is Long</h1>
      <p>This is not a love-dovey story.  
      This is the real, raw, chaotic, beautiful journey of someone trying to build something that matters.</p>
    </div>
  
    <!-- Section: Pre-Opening and The Wolf -->
    <div class="card" data-aos="fade-up">
      <h2>🏗️ I Built This Place</h2>
      <p>Where I work, I was there from the very beginning — pre-opening.  
      It's like I helped lay the first bricks, built the walls, infused it with life.  
      People came and went. That's normal.  
      What wasn’t normal was being forgotten — being unseen, even by the very place you helped build.</p>
  
      <p>At a staff party, the theme was "Dress as something starting with W."  
      Classic me — I went full on WEREWOLF. 🐺</p>
  
      <p>Surprisingly, everyone kept asking:  
      > "Who's the wolf?"</p>
  
      <p>When I finally unmasked —  
      > "Oh... it's you." 😶</p>
  
      <p>In my head, I was full Breaking Bad mode:  
      > "I BUILT THIS PLACE. SAY MY NAME!" 🌋</p>
  
      <p>But nobody did.  
      And something cracked inside me that day.</p>
    </div>
  
    <!-- Section: Frustration with the Team -->
    <div class="card" data-aos="fade-up">
      <h2>🤯 Trying to Lift Everyone</h2>
      <p>I was the supervisor.  
      My team? Mostly Nepalese like me.  
      Some of them, I saw pieces of myself in.  
      Others? Complete idiots. 😅 (Just being honest.)</p>
  
      <p>I used to joke they must have left their brains at home before coming to work.  
      I pushed them hard — to speak English, to communicate better, to rise.</p>
  
      <p>During slow times, I was friendly.  
      During busy times — volcano mode erupted. 🌋</p>
  
      <p>One tiny mistake, and boom — explosion.  
      But like a volcano, I cooled down just as quickly.</p>
  
      <p>We even had a toolbox talk about communicating in English.  
      Guess what? Nobody signed it.  
      I got furious.  
      Long story short — some of them complained about me.</p>
  
      <p>Their words:  
      > "Dominant."  
      > "Dictatorship."  
      > "Split personality."</p>
  
      <p>They weren't entirely wrong either. 🎭</p>

      <h2>🍻 Drunken Destiny: The Book That Found Me</h2>
      <p>I needed answers.  
      I went to talk with my old friend Sandeep.  
      Funny story — we ended up drinking. 🍻</p>
  
      <p>The next morning... a package at my door.  
      Inside —  
      > **_Surrounded by Idiots._** 🤣</p>
  
      <p>To this day, I don't even remember ordering it.  
      Drunken destiny, I guess.</p>
  
      <p>I opened it. I started reading.  
      And suddenly —  
      dots started connecting everywhere. 🔗</p>

    <!-- Section: Workforce of the Future -->
    <div class="card" data-aos="fade-up">
      <h2>🧠 Remembering The Clues</h2>
      <p>During my Professional Year Program, our facilitator Jeevan made us go to a website —  
      Workforce of the Future —  
      to find out what kind of employees we were:  
      Red 🔥, Green 🌿, Yellow ☀️, Blue 🌊.</p>
  
      <p>Everyone else laughed it off.  
      Me?  
      I bookmarked it.  
      Without knowing that one day, this would become a core part of my understanding of people.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Surrounded by Idiots wasn't new knowledge for me —  
      it was a forgotten truth finally waking up again.</strong></p>

    <!-- Section: Rabbit Hole Discovery -->
    <div class="card" data-aos="fade-up">
      <h2>🕳️ Falling Into The Rabbit Hole</h2>
      <p>Since then, I've kept digging.  
      Kept building.  
      Kept falling deeper into the psychological rabbit hole.</p>

      From inside?  
      It's endless.</p>

    <!-- Section: Psychological Kundali -->
    <div class="card" data-aos="fade-up">
      <h2>📿🧠 The Psychological Kundali</h2>
      <p>Born in a Hindu background, raised reading Kundalis,  
      I thought my anger, my talkative nature, my instincts —  
      were all destined by the gada, rakchyasa, dev, manusya inside me.</p>
  
      <p>But some people are just... built different.</p>
  
      <p>Today, my dream is to build a Psychological Kundali —  
      not mapping your stars,  
      but mapping your instincts.  
      Your Red, Yellow, Green, Blue energies.</p>
  
      <p>Where spirituality and psychology dance together. 🌌</p>
  
      <p><strong>Foolish by design.  
      Brilliant by instinct.  
      Watch like a director. Strike like a pirate.  
      Legend in the making. 🏴‍☠️🎬</strong></p>

    <!-- Section: Walking In Darkness -->
    <div class="card" data-aos="fade-up">
      <h2>🌌 Walking In Darkness</h2>
      <p>I believe in this deeply:</p>
  
      <blockquote>
        <em>“I could walk in the dark —<br/>
        I may stumble on pits and fall —<br/>
        and I will get where I want to go.<br/>
        But if someone shows the light,<br/>
        it won’t be that slow,<br/>
        and I might not fall as much.”</em>
      </blockquote>
  
      <p>That's why I build what I build.  
      To leave behind a few lights for those still walking in the dark.</p>
  
      <p>And if I can,  
      I will always show the light —  
      so someone else doesn't have to stumble the way I did.</p>
  
      <p>Truth is —  
      most of the time,  
      I'm still walking in the dark myself. 🌌</p>

      <h2>🌱 Planting Seeds</h2>
      <p>I don't want fame.  
      I don't want fortune.</p>
  
      <p>If I can plant one small seed inside you —  
      one moment of reflection,  
      one tiny pause before judgement —  
      then my work is done.</p>
