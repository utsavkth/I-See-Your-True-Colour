# I See Your True Colour Shining Through 🌈

Discover your true personality colour — Red, Yellow, Green, or Blue — through real-world scenarios, not boring theoretical questions.  
Inspired by *Surrounded by Idiots* by Thomas Erikson, this emotional reflection tool invites you to understand your instincts, behaviours, and natural energies.

## ✨ Features

- 12 Real-Life Scenario-Based Questions

## 🎯 How It Works

- Each answer you choose secretly maps to a color.
- At the end of the quiz, your dominant color is revealed.
- If your top two colors are close, a secondary influence is also shown.
